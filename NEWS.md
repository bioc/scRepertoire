# scRepertoire VERSION 2.7.2

* `getCirclize()` major enhancements:
  * Multi-level hierarchical grouping via `group.by` accepting a vector of columns

  * New `order.strata` parameter for controlling level ordering within each stratum
  * Enhanced `export.table` output now includes `freq`, `prop`, and `rank` columns
* `combineBCR()` defaults the clustering call to "IGH" instead of "both"
