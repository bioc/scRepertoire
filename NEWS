CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1
------------------------
# I think we can all agree I need to get better at version control - as of right now bioconductor is # at v1.3, so the better alignment here is to start the version alignment at 1.3.1, sorry for the 
# confusion

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
------------------------

# Universalizing the versions across GitHub and bioconductor, we are now at 1.2 for bioconductor
# and v1.2.1 for the master. Dev branch will be updated to reflect this change to v1.2.2. Apologies 
# for the confusion.

* Updated coding practices based on devtools and bioccheck
* Deprecated VizVgene() support - erroring during build and new version in dev branch to visualize any gene
* fixed lengthDF handling of single chains with multi chains stored - ;
* Changed grabMeta to include assessment of colnames
* number of changes to the parseTCR/BCR functions to limit assumptions


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.4
------------------------

* replaced hammingCompare with lvCompare to enable superior clonotype calling in combineBCR function.
* added proportion to combineExpression() function so users no longer need to know absolute frequencies when combining the contiguous information. 
* added clusterTCR() and clonalOverlay() functions.
* added downsampling to the diversity calculations
* replaced hammingCompare with lvCompare to enable superior clonotype calling in combineBCR function.
* added proportion to combineExpression() function so users no longer need to know absolute frequencies when combining the contiguous information. 
* added clusterTCR() and clonalOverlay() functions.
* added downsampling to the diversity calculations
* Clonal Overlap Coefficient issue fixed, was comparing unique barcodes and not clonotypes
* Added function checkBlanks to remove list elements without clonotypes, this prevents errors for visualizations
* Re-added Startrac metrics by stripping down the package and adding it piecemeal
* Heavily modified dependencies to reduce total number 


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

* removed dependencies ggfittext and ggdendrogram
* clonesizeDistribution now returns a plot() function

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.10
------------------------
