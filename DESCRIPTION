Description: scRepertoire is a toolkit for processing and analyzing single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig). The scRepertoire framework supports use of 10x, AIRR, BD, MiXCR, Omniscope, TRUST4, and WAT3R single-cell formats. The functionality includes basic clonal analyses, repertoire summaries, distance-based clustering and interaction with the popular Seurat and SingleCellExperiment/Bioconductor R workflows.
